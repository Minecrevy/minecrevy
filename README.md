# Minecrevy

## What is Minecrevy?

A Minecraft server API written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), powered by the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) game engine.

## Design Goals

- **Modular**: Use what you want, replace what you don't.
- **Unified**: Easily share common components between your game server and server proxy.
- **Fast**: Run many entities and chunks with a parallel-first architecture.

## Community

- **Discord (soon):** Minecrevy's official discord server.
